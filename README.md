# November Nineteenth

A twitter bot that replies to anyone who isn't aware that there is, in fact, an International Men's Day.

## Why?

The comedian Richard Herring has been [doing this job manually](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/comedians/richard-herring-spends-international-womens-day-fighting-sexism/) every International Women's Day (because for some _unknown reason_, this is when people like to display their ignorance) for a while, but one human being at a keyboard can only do so much, so this little script thought it would help out a bit.

## How?

Clone this repo.

Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and fill out the fields with tokens/keys you can create [here](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Then, in your terminal, `cd` into the project directory and run:

    npm install
    node index.js
